## 0.1.3

* Centralized third-party source code in `//third_party_base/` and separated it from our code.
  * However, our Dart code and C++ code do not directly reference `//third_party_base/`, but instead access it through symbolic links from each `third_party/` directory. This is due to limitations in Dart. Additionally, when uploading packages to Pub, `//third_party_base/` is not uploaded, and instead symbolic links within each `third_party/` directory are materialized into regular files. For more details, refer to [third_party_base/README.md](./third_party_base/README.md) and [create_symlinks_to_third_party](./create_symlinks_to_third_party.sh).
* ThirdPartyNotices.txt is now auto-generated by [create_symlinks_to_third_party](./create_symlinks_to_third_party.sh).
* Changed the internal process of building the subprocess-executable. Previously, symbolic links were created to `//linux/subprocess/src/*` in the CEF binary distribution, but this has been discontinued. Please refer to `//linux/README.md` and `//linux/CMakeLists.txt` for details on the new build process.
* Fixed build errors with clang 15.
* Improvements to the documentation.
